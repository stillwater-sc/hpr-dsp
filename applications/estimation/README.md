# Kalman filter

This is a linear Kalman filter using [MTL4](http://www.simunova.com). 
Based on the algorithm presented in the paper [An Introduction to the Kalman Filter](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf).

It is a demonstration of the benefits of custom posit configurations and the error-free linear algebra.
